Maybe you know this already but just in case --> the install from zip is only an option at 2.18 _if_ the Boundless Connect plugin is installed. When that plugin is installed it adds the option to install a plugin from a zip. If the Boundless Connect plugin is not installed - can you test the manual method of placing the plugin directly in to the plugins folder on the OS and the unzipping it?

ok to install it manually you unzip the plugin into the {user_home_folder}/.qgis2/python/plugins

if there is no plugins folder (which means no external plugin was ever installed) he needs to create one
